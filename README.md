### Getting higher on rugged landscapes
by L. Trujillo, P. Banse and G. Beslon (2022)

#### Abstract
Molecular evolution is often conceptualised as adaptive walks on rugged fitness
landscapes, driven by mutations and constrained by incremental fitness selection. It is
well known that epistasis shapes the ruggedness of the landscapeâ€™s surface outlining
their topography (with high-fitness peaks separated by valleys of low fitness genotypes).
However, within the strong selection weak mutation (SSWM) limit, once an adaptive
walk reaches a local peak, natural selection restricts passage through downstream paths
and hampers any possibility of reaching higher fitness values. Here, in addition to the
widely used point mutations, we introduce a minimal model of sequence inversions to
simulate adaptive walks. We use the well known NK model to instantiate rugged
landscapes. We show that adaptive walks can reach higher fitness values through
inversion mutations, which, compared to point mutations, implies that the evolutionary
process escapes local fitness peaks. To elucidate the effects of this chromosomal
rearrangement, we use a graph-theoretic representation of accessible mutants and show
how new evolutionary paths are uncovered. The present model suggests a simple
mechanistic rationale to analyse escapes from local fitness peaks in molecular evolution
driven by (intragenic) structural inversions and reveals some consequences of the limits
of point mutations for simulations of molecular evolution.

The preprint is available on (soon on arXiv)
